      "description": "This project allows a user to create and use their own custom flashcards. I originally built this in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in week 6 of Foundations at Dev Academy Aotearoa, and then recreated the entire project as a fullstack application in week 7 of Bootcamp. While building this app, I learnt how to incorporate JavaScript logic into React and React Query, reinforced my learning on prop drilling and state management in React, learnt how to create and query relational SQLite3 databases with many to many relationships, built my first dynamic form in React, and worked with the framer-motion npm package for the first time. While deploying this app, also I learnt how to refactor my code to query my production database, which was migrated to PostgreSQL.",

      "description": "This is a Dev Academy Aotearoa project which I was challenged to finish and deploy. I was given an existing boilerplate and styling, and used this to build a fullstack application which shows a user a list of 'todos', or tasks and the status of those tasks. Once I finished developing the app, I deployed it using Dokku. This was my first time deploying a project. It was also my first time building a fullstack application from scratch, and I learnt how to prop-drill data into subcomponents in React, querying and mutating data with ReactQuery, how to prepare an application for deployment (particularly how an app is built for production), and how to deploy with Dokku.",
